# Ocatune

Ocatune helps you to play the ocarina in tune by listening to you play and providing real-time audio feedback.

Learning to play the ocarina in tune can be difficult, but it does not have to be. Pitch errors are very obvious when you play against a reference tone. The ocarina itself cannot give you one, as it can only sound one note at a time, which is where Ocatune comes in.

Ocatune listens to your playing using your computer's microphone and plays a reference pitch, the closest equal tempered note to the one you are playing. This enables you to easily hear and correct your tuning errors, as you can hear 'beating' when the pitches don't match.

(Essentially, Ocatune simulates the physical behaviour of sympathetic resonance).

Using audio feedback is superior to practicing with a chromatic tuner that displays pitch graphically, as it directly hones your listening skills.
